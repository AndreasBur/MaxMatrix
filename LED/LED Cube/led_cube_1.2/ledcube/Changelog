1.2
- fixed bug in space invaders, works properly now
1.1
- added some NOPs to the view functions, sometimes the leds on the bottom layer were
unintentionally active otherwise (very short/weak, but noticeable).
- fixed random selector in main.c (commented out by default)
- added space invaders animation (some pixels act strange in the second run, not sure why)
